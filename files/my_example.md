Here's a great example header
=============================

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Proin venenatis felis ac pede. Nunc turpis. Integer dolor magna, egestas quis, pharetra vitae, pulvinar et, odio. Nulla a neque quis eros congue luctus. Duis tempus dolor vel metus. Sed vestibulum luctus tortor. Quisque molestie porttitor lacus. Nulla nec libero at tortor mattis ultricies.

A **strong tag** and an _em tag_ get styled like so.

How about [a link to my site](http://honestcode.com/)?

## H2 header

### Lists

* they look like this
* it's how you'd format them in pure markdown, if you took the time to indent when it wrapped to a new line.

### Ordered lists

1. here's one line from a numbered list
1. here's another
1. in markdown, the actual numbers don't matter

### Block quotes

> This is a blockquote that extends
> to multiple lines.
> 
> With repeating email-style angle brackets.

### Code blocks

    (function() {
        console.log('code blocks indent four spaces');
    })()

### Different headers

#### h4 header

##### h5 header

###### h6 header

That's an hr above. It just works!

However, images will still look like images. Deal with it.
